# sudoku-solver

This sudoku solver is able to solve sudokus of the sizes 4x4, 9x9 and 16x16. The user can enter any (except for a few exceptions, see "known issues" paragraphs) starting state of the sudoku grid and the program will return a solved sudoku.
It uses a standard backtracking algorithm and was built using the Liberica Full 24 jdk.
